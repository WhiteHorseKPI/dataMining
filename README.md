# dataMining: Laboratory Work in Data Analysis

## About  
This repository hosts a series of Jupyter notebooks designed as hands-on laboratory exercises in data mining and data analysis. Each notebook walks through stages such as data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, modelling, and evaluation.
